# PS_GAM_Management
A PSE (Plain Stupid English) interface using PowerShell to manage Google Workspace accounts and Chrome Devices

I wrote this script as a way to easily manage users and devices in Google Workspace for the school I work at. I love the GAM suite of tools but for what I want out of it, I didn't want to have to memorize commands and syntaxes. I just wanted an easy way to put in a device Asset ID and let it rip.

This script has the following pre-requisites:
1. Google Apps Manager (GAM)
2. The PowerShell Module "ImportExcel"
3. An Excel document in which you input

Please note: this was written specifically with my environment in mind, please edit the script as appropriate for your environment
